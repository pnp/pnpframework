# Create a PR with your changes

> [!Note]
> When you want to make changes it's recommended to isolate each change in a separate PR and that's best done by creating a branch per change. Having a branch per change allows you to work on multiple changes while you still can submit them as individual PR's. To create a new branch starting from the dev branch you can use `git checkout -b mybranch dev`. To push this branch to GitHub you can use `git push -u mybranch`.

Once you've coded and tested your contribution you'll need to create a pull request (PR) again the dev branch of the https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework repository:

- Go to **Pull requests** in your fork and click on the green **New pull request** button
- Ensure you've configured the base repository to be the `pnp/pnpframework` repo using the `dev` branch


- Click on **Create pull request**, provide a descriptive title and description and click on **Create pull request**
- Ensure all **checks** have passed

> ![Note]
> Please be sure to remove all of your password, usernames and tenant addresses from the sample scripts - this is to maintain the security of your tenant. Examples include replacing the > organisation name with Contoso e.g. https://contoso.sharepoint.com giving the details of the type of address but hiding the key information.


## How you are recognized for your submissions

In PnP, we are all about community and we want to recognize your contributions. We have a few ways to do this

## Community Calls

Your submission is announced on the next "Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Development Community call", Bi-weekly on Thursdays 7:00 AM PT / 3:00 PM GMT.
You are invited to join the call and we will provide a mention of your submission as a Thank you! - Join here: [https://aka.ms/spdev-sig-call-join](https://aka.ms/spdev-sig-call-join)

## PnP Blog

We run a monthly blog post on the [PnP blog](https://pnp.github.io/blog/), where we highlight the submissions we received in the previous month. You will be mentioned in the blog post and we will list your sample and name.

## Social Media

We will share your submission on our social media channels, typically Twitter, when they are processed by the team.

## Badges!

Finally, as a Thank you for your contributions, we invite you to opt-in into the PnP Recognition Program. This will give you access to a badge that you can use on your social media profiles, blog posts, and other places to show that you are a PnP contributor. You can opt-in here: [https://pnp.github.io/recognitionprogram/](https://pnp.github.io/recognitionprogram/)

You will receive a badge in a batch run (might be a few weeks) when you have submitted your first sample - that's it.

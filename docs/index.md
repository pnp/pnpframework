# PnP Framework documentation

**PnP Framework** is a .NET Standard 2.0 / .NET 5.0 / .NET 6.0 / .NET 7.0 library targeting Microsoft 365 containing the PnP Provisioning engine and a ton of other useful extensions. This library is the cross platform successor of the [PnP-Sites-Core](https://github.com/PnP/PnP-Sites-Core) library. The original [PnP-Sites-Core](https://github.com/PnP/PnP-Sites-Core) library only works on Windows (due to the dependency on .Net Framework) and supports SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online, while this library will work cross platform but only supports SharePoint Online. Going forward we'll only be **actively maintaining PnP Framework**, the [PnP-Sites-Core](https://github.com/PnP/PnP-Sites-Core) library is retired and archived.

Next to PnP Framework that will be replacing [PnP-Sites-Core](https://github.com/PnP/PnP-Sites-Core) we're also building a brand new [PnP Core SDK](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore) that targets modern .NET development and which will work everywhere where .NET will run. This library is the long term evolution of PnP Framework, we'll enable a phased transition from PnP Framework to [PnP Core SDK](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore) without impacting PnP Framework users.

## Migrating from PnP Sites Core

This library is the cross platform successor of the [PnP-Sites-Core](https://github.com/PnP/PnP-Sites-Core), see the [Migrating from PnP Sites Core to PnP Framework guide](using-the-framework/MigratingFromPnPSitesCore.md) to learn how to switch over.

## I've found a bug, where do I need to log an issue or create a PR

Issues and PR's need to be created in the PnP Framework repo, the PnP Sites Core repo has been archived.

## Supportability and SLA

This library is open-source and community provided component with active community providing support for it.

# Getting Started

The PnP Provisioning Engine is a set of libraries and tools that enable the creation and deployment of site templates and artifacts in SharePoint Online and SharePoint on-premises. The engine includes a set of .NET libraries that can be used to programmatically create and apply templates, as well as a console application that can be used to apply templates from the command line. The templates can include site columns, content types, lists, libraries, pages, and other SharePoint artifacts. 

Key features of PnP Provisioning include:

- Create templates from existing SharePoint sites
- Apply templates to existing SharePoint sites
- Site level or tenant level provisioning
- Pass parameters to the templates
- Captures a wide range of SharePoint artifacts


## PnP Provisioning Schema

The PnP Provisioning templates are based on an XML schema that captures the structure and content of a SharePoint site. The schema is extensible and can be used to capture a wide range of SharePoint artifacts. The schema is located here: [Schema 09/2022 | PnP Provisioning Schema](https://github.com/pnp/PnP-Provisioning-Schema/blob/master/ProvisioningSchema-2022-09.md)


## Using the Polyglot Notebook samples

The PolyGlot samples provide working examples of how to interact with SharePoint, that can be ran against your Microsoft 365 tenant, written in C#.

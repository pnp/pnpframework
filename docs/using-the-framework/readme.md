XXX

## Where is the code?

The PnP Framework is maintained in the PnP GitHub repository: https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework. You'll find:

- The code of the PnP Framework in the `src\sdk\lib` folder
- The source of the documentation you are reading right now in the `docs` folder

## Referencing the PnP Core SDK in your project

The recommended approach is to use the preview XXXX together with the XXX. 
Each night these preview packages are refreshed, so you can always upgrade to the latest dev bits by upgrading your nuget package to the latest version.
